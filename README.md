Linux configuration files
=========================

Set of linux configuration files, mainly targeted for web and/or web application servers servicing a high number of simultaneous connections. As such, this repository should mimic the directory structure of a classical linux /etc folder (ubuntu/debian-based).
The idea is to build some kind of reference files, self-described files, that identify the parameters that should be changed, that can be changed and that should not be changed, with some explanation about when to change them.

Everything that is a matter of personnal taste should be excluded, or at least strongly defended.
